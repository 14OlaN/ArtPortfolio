			<h2>About The Piece</h2>
			<p>My painting is inspired by New York City, but since this is a post-apocalyptic scene, most of the buildings are destroyed. The only clue that this was New York is the remains of the Empire State Building right next to the smallest glass dome. I didn't want it to be clear what city it was to show how ruined the world was, so I didn't pay much attention to making the rest of the skyline similar to New York. The only element added to the city is, obviously, the glass domes. These buildings weren't inspired by any city in particular, but a general pattern of every city silhouette.</p>

			<p>The focal point is the largest glass structure on the top right corner because it contrasts with the rest of the painting's dark colors. One reason for placing it there was to use three point perspective. The other reason was to lead the viewers from the top right corner to the next structure on the left, and finally down to the dark buildings. This lets them travel through the entire painting.</p>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 40px">Perspective</h2>
			<p>â€‹I used aerial perspective in my final painting. It's visible in the dark buildings at the bottom of the painting and the buildings on platforms. While I still painted them gradually lighter the farther they were, I also painted each building or parts of it differently instead of creating layers of buildings that would be painted in the same color.</p>
